Step 1: Understanding Monolithic vs Microservices

Concept:

Monolithic Architecture: Single deployable unit. All modules tightly coupled.

Example: A Spring Boot app with controllers, services, and repositories all in one application.

Microservices Architecture: Application split into multiple small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service has its own database (optional) and communicates over lightweight protocols (HTTP, gRPC, messaging).

Why Microservices:

Independent deployability → faster releases.

Scalability → scale only the service under high load.

Fault isolation → failure in one service doesn’t crash the whole system.

Technology heterogeneity → different microservices can use different tech stacks.

Example:

E-commerce system:

Order Service → handles orders

Payment Service → handles payments

Inventory Service → handles stock
Each service can be written in Spring Boot, deployed separately, and communicate via REST or messaging.

Step 2: Service Design Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle:

Each microservice should handle one business capability.

2. Database per Service:

Each service ideally has its own database to prevent tight coupling.

Example: OrderService uses PostgreSQL, InventoryService uses MongoDB.

3. Loose Coupling:

Services communicate via well-defined APIs (REST/gRPC) instead of direct method calls.

4. API Versioning:

Ensure backward compatibility when updating APIs.

Example: /api/v1/orders vs /api/v2/orders.

Step 3: Building Your First Microservice with Spring Boot

Example: OrderService

Create a Spring Boot project with:

Spring Web (REST endpoints)

Spring Data JPA (Database integration)

H2 (in-memory DB for testing)

Order Entity:

@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String product;
    private int quantity;
    private double price;
    
    // getters and setters
}


Order Repository:

@Repository
public interface OrderRepository extends JpaRepository<Order, Long> {}


Order Service:

@Service
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private OrderRepository repository;

    public Order createOrder(Order order) {
        return repository.save(order);
    }

    public List<Order> getAllOrders() {
        return repository.findAll();
    }
}


Order Controller:

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/orders")
public class OrderController {
    @Autowired
    private OrderService service;

    @PostMapping
    public Order createOrder(@RequestBody Order order) {
        return service.createOrder(order);
    }

    @GetMapping
    public List<Order> getOrders() {
        return service.getAllOrders();
    }
}


✅ Run this service independently, test endpoints via Postman or curl.

Step 4: Communication Between Microservices

1. Synchronous Communication (HTTP/REST):

Example: PaymentService calls OrderService REST endpoint to check order before processing payment.

2. Asynchronous Communication (Messaging):

Example: Using Kafka or RabbitMQ to send order events (OrderCreated) to other services asynchronously.

At this stage, you’ll have:

A microservice running independently

Knowledge of REST APIs for communication
